## Others

I must agress [@st3fan](https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl) said:

> OpenSSL is not a good choice for getting access to crypto primitives or for SSL/TLS networking in iOS applications.
>
> Instead, you should use the iOS provided libraries.
>
> The native iOS Security and Networking Frameworks will always be more up to date and receive regular security fixes as part of iOS upgrades.
